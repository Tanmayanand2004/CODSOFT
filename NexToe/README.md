   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**
   - Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\\Scripts\\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

6. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to `http://localhost:5000`

## How to Play

1. **Choose Your Symbol**: Select X or O (X goes first by default)
2. **Make Your Move**: Click any empty cell or use number keys (1-9)
3. **AI Response**: The AI will immediately respond with its move
4. **Win Conditions**: Get three in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally)
5. **Game Over**: Modal displays the result with options to play again

## Keyboard Controls

- **1-9**: Make a move in the corresponding cell
- **R**: Reset/New game
- **Escape**: Close modal

## AI Algorithm

The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** with **Alpha-Beta pruning**:

### Minimax Algorithm
- Evaluates all possible game states
- Assumes both players play optimally
- Chooses moves that maximize AI's chances while minimizing player's chances

### Alpha-Beta Pruning
- Optimization technique that reduces computation time
- Prunes branches that won't affect the final decision
- Maintains the same optimal result with better performance

### Difficulty Levels
- **Impossible**: Full Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning (unbeatable)
- **Hard**: Minimax without pruning
- **Medium**: Reduced depth search (future enhancement)

## API Endpoints

### POST /api/move
Make a move and get AI response
```json
{
  "board": ["X", "", "", "", "O", "", "", "", ""],
  "position": 1,
  "player": "X"
}
```

### POST /api/reset
Reset the game board
```json
{
  "board": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""],
  "game_over": false,
  "winner": null
}
```

## Features in Detail

### Theme System
- Automatic dark/light theme detection
- Manual theme toggle with persistence
- Smooth transitions between themes
- CSS custom properties for easy customization

### Sound System
- Move sounds for player and AI actions
